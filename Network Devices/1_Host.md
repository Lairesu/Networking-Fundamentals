# Host

A **host** is any devices that sends or receives traffic within a network.
Examples include:

- **End-User devices:** Laptops, computers, smartphones
- **Cloud Resources:** virtual machines, containers or other cloud components
- **IoT Devices:** devices like smart TVs, printers, speakers
- **Servers:** web server, database servers, mail servers

## Categories of Hosts:

### 1. **Client**
- Initiates the communication.
- Requests data or services
- **Example:** A browser (client) requests a web page from a web server
  
### 2. **Server**
- Responds to client requests
- Provides data, processing or service
- **Examples** A web server sends back the requested web page.
  
> Note: The terms _client_ and _server_ are relative depending on the communication.  
> Example:
>
> - The browser (client) requests data from the backend (server).
> - The backend (client) requests data from the database (server).
> - When the database needs updates, the updater becomes the server, and the database becomes the client.
