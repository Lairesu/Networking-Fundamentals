# HUBs

A **HUB** is the simplest form of a network device.\
It connects multiple computers or network devices together and acts as a
**multiport repeater**.\
Whenever a hub receives data from one of its ports, it **broadcasts**
that data to every other connected port.

### Example:

If Host1 sends data to Host2 through a hub, the hub also sends that data
to Host3 and Host4 --- even though they weren't meant to receive it.

This causes **data collisions** and **inefficiency**.
