# Repeater

When hosts are far apart, the signal weakens over distance — this is called signal decay.  
**Repeaters** are devices that amplify or regenerate the weakened signal and resend it so it can reach other connected devices.

They don’t change or interpret the data — they simply **repeat** the signal.
