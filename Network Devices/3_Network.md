# Network

### **Definition**
A **network** is a system that connects multiple hosts (computers, phones, servers, IoT devices, etc.) to share **data, resources, and services**.  
In short, a network transports traffic between hosts — instead of using physical media like USB drives or CDs to exchange data, the network allows **electronic communication**.

---

## Before Networks
Originally, to transfer data between computers, people used **physical media** such as:
- 💾 Floppy disks  
- 💿 CDs/DVDs  
- 🔌 Flash drives  

These methods were **manual and slow** — a person had to carry the data from one device to another (called the **Sneakernet 🏃‍♂️💾**).

Networks automated this process by allowing devices to communicate directly over **cables or wireless links**.

---

## What a Network Does
A network:
1. Connects hosts so they can send/receive data.  
2. Defines rules and structures (**protocols, addressing, etc.**) for communication.  
3. Manages resources, like printers, files, and Internet connections.  
4. Can scale from a few devices (**home**) to millions (**Internet**).

## Examples of Networks

| **Environment** | **Description** | **Example Devices** |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Home network | Small network using a Wi-Fi router. | Smartphones, laptops, TVs |
| Office or coffee shop | Local network (LAN) for staff/customers. | Laptops, tablets, printers |
| School or university | Multiple sub-networks connected together. | Labs, classrooms, admin PCs |
| Internet | A global interconnection of all networks. | Everything online |

## Analogy
Think of a **college** as the overall network:
- The college itself → large host or network  
- 🧑Classrooms → sub-networks (LANs)  
- All classrooms connect through a **main server or router**  
- Beyond that, everything connects to the **Internet**, the “network of networks.”

## The Internet
The **Internet** is the **largest network** in existence — it interconnects **millions of smaller networks** (home, business, academic, etc.) using standard protocols (mainly **TCP/IP**).

---

## 🛰️ ISP (Internet Service Provider)
An **ISP** connects smaller networks (like your home Wi-Fi or a college network) to the **Internet**.  
You can think of it like a **bridge or gateway** that lets your private network talk to the rest of the world.

**Analogy:**  
If an **API connects software** together, an **ISP connects networks** together.

## Summary
> - A **network** connects hosts so they can exchange data electronically.  
> - Before networks, communication required **physical data transfer**.  
> - Networks exist at many scales: **home**, **business**, **global (Internet)**.  
> - **ISPs** link private networks to the **global Internet**.
