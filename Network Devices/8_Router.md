# 5. Router
When networks grow and multiple subnets exist, we use **Routers** to connect them.  
A router facilitates communication **between networks** (not just within).

Routers manage:
- **Routing paths** (deciding the best way to reach the destination)
- **Traffic control** (security, filtering, redirecting)
- **Gateway connections** (entry and exit points of networks)

## Example:
Denmark (IP: 134.3.3.x) and Japan (IP: 123.2.4.x).  
To send data from Copenhagen (134.3.3.8) to Kyoto (123.2.4.7), packets travel through routers using **routing paths** — each router forwards it to the next until it reaches the destination.

## Gateway:
A **Gateway** is the “way out” of a local network — the router interface that connects to the outside world.
