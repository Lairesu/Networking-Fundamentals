# 🌐 Layers 5–7: Session, Presentation & Application (Unified Application Layer)

## Overview

Before the Internet era, OSI layers 5, 6, and 7 had **independent roles**.  
However, in modern networking (like the **TCP/IP model**), these are **combined into a single “Application Layer.”**  
Thus, we mainly focus on Layers **1–4** for understanding **data flow and encapsulation**.
