# 🧩 Layer 2 – Data Link Layer

Known as the **hop-to-hop delivery layer**.

- It works **closely with the physical layer**.
- Responsible for **framing** and **error detection** during transmission.
- Uses **MAC (Media Access Control) addresses** to identify devices within the same local network.

## Examples:

- **NIC (Network Interface Card)** / Wi-Fi Access Card
  - Older NICs were large, but now they fit inside smartwatches or phones!
- **Switches**

## MAC Address:

A unique identifier assigned to each NIC.

Examples of MAC address formats:

- `95-9c-83-4b-eb-45` → Windows
- `95:9c:83:4b:eb:45` → Linux
- `959c.834b.eb45` → Routers/Switches (divided into 3 groups of 4 hex digits)
